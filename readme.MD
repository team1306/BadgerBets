Scouting app with a twist

## Running locally
Ensure all dependencies are installed. From the root, run:
```
npm install
```

Launch the development server
```
npm run serve
```

This uses a dev dependency ```lite-server``` that watches files and automagically refreshes the browser when a file change is detected
